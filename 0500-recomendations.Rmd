## Weigert Creek - PSCIS crossing 197534
Numerous westslope cuthrout trout were captured downstream and upstream of the crossing with a notable increase in the density of adult fish upstream of the crossing.  Although habitat was suitable above Reach 2 and in fact had more complexity due to large woody debris abundance and percent composition of pools there were no fish captured in the areas samppled. this was a surprising result as the entire section of stream between where was sampled in Reach 3 and where fish were captured in Reach 2 was surveyed and although some drops were present no permanent barriers were present.
