"],["intro.html", "1 Introduction", " 1 Introduction Since 2020, the Canadian Wildlife Federation (CWF) has been working on a watershed connectivity remediation plan for the Elk River watershed that incorporates the provincial Strategic Approach protocol (Fish Passage Assessment, Habitat Confirmation, Design and Remediation), evolution of the bcfishpass analysis tools (Norris [2020] 2023) and local knowledge of the watershed to prioritize barriers and restore connectivity for westslope cutthroat trout and other species in a strategic manner. Nupqu Resource Limited Partnership (Nupqu) was retained by the CWF in the summer of 2022 to conduct fish habitat and fish sampling assessments at sites related to road-stream crossings within the Elk River watershed group as part of this connectivity restoration planning. Subject streams included Brule Creek, Weigert Creek and an unnamed tributary to Bighorn Creek. New Graph Environment Ltd. was sub-contracted by Nupqu to assist with project delivery. Assessments conducted in 2022 complement work completed in 2020 (72 fish passage assessments and 15 habitat confirmation assessments) and 2021 (92 fish passage assessments and 15 habitat confirmation assessments) which can be viewed interactively online at https://newgraphenvironment.github.io/fish_passage_elk_2020_reporting_cwf/ (Irvine 2021) and https://newgraphenvironment.github.io/fish_passage_elk_2021_reporting/ (Irvine 2022). The health and viability of freshwater fish populations can depend on access to tributary and off channel areas which provide refuge during high flows, opportunities for foraging, overwintering habitat, spawning habitat and summer rearing habitat (Bramblett et al. 2002; Swales and Levings 1989; Diebel et al. 2015). Culverts can present barriers to fish migration due to low water depth, increased water velocity, turbulence, a vertical drop at the culvert outlet and/or maintenance issues (Slaney, Zaldokas, and Watershed Restoration Program (B.C.) 1997; Cote et al. 2005). As the costs of works for remediation of fish passage issues through the replacement of road/stream crossings can be significant, acquisition of detailed habitat and fish sampling data can be helpful for understanding the value of associated habitats to target fish species, attempting to understand the extent of the issues potentially created by subject culverts as well as providing baseline data for assessing the benefits of remedial work post-fish passage remediation. "],["background.html", "2 Background 2.1 Fisheries", " 2 Background Study areas for 2022 field work included Brule Creek, Weigert Creek and an unnamed tributary to Bighorn Creek. Although portions of the Elk River watershed group flow into the Flathead River all streams included in 2022 fieldwork were within the portion of the Elk River watershed group that flows into the Elk River (Figure 2.1). The Elk River has a mean annual discharge of 26 m3/s at station 08NK016 near Sparwood and 47.3 m3/s at station 08NK016 near Fernie with flow patterns typical of high elevation watersheds on the west side of the Rocky Mountains which receive large amounts of precipitation as snow leading to peak levels of discharge during snowmelt, typically from May to July (Figures 2.2 - 2.4) (Environment and Canada 2020). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/Overview_ELKR.png&quot;) Figure 2.1: Overview map of Study Area knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08NK016.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/pixel.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08NK002.png&quot;) Figure 2.2: Hydrograph for Elk River near Sparwood (Station #08NK016) and near Fernie (Station #08NK002). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrology_stats_08NK016b.png&quot;) Figure 2.3: Elk River Near Sparwood (Station #08NK016 - Lat 49.86562 Lon -114.86868).

When Europeans settled in the Kootenay Region around 200 hundred years ago, the Indian Reserves were created which lead to the seven Indian Bands: ʔakisq̓nuk- Columbia Lake Band (Windermere, BC); ʔaq̓am- St. Mary’s Band (Cranbrook, BC); ʔakink̓umǂasnuqǂiʔit- Tobacco Plains Band (Grasmere, BC); yaqan nuʔkiy- Lower Kootenay Band (Creston, BC); kyaknuqǂiʔit- Shuswap Band (Invermere, BC); ʔaq̓anqmi- Kootenai Tribe of Idaho (Bonners Ferry, Idaho); k̓upawi¢q̓nuk- Ksanka Band (Elmo, Montana) “Ktunaxa Nation” (2020) report the vision statement of the Ktunaxa as: “Kȼmak̓qa ksukⱡuⱡa·k kuk̓qani ȼ k̓itqakiⱡ haqa ksiʔⱡ ȼxa ʔa·kⱡukqaʔis ksukiⱡq̓ukaʔmi·k kiʔin Ktunaxa naʔs ʔamak̓ʔis.

Subsurface resource exploration and develpment is prohibited in the Flathead River watershed due to legislation enacted in 2011. At the time of reporting there were four active coal mines in the Elk River watershed (Fording River, Greenhills, Line Creek and Elkview), one closed mine (Coal Mountain) as well as multiple exploration projects and proposed new mines [@ministryofenergy2020EastKootenay]. First Nations, stakeholders, proponents and provincial and municipal governments have recognized that the region has been impacted by historic and current coal operations as well as other stresses such as forestry operations, wildfire, residential development, recreational activities and transportation. To assess the historic, current and potential future conditions of valued ecosystem components and to support resource management decisions within the region, the Provincial Cumulative Effects Framework and the Elk Valley Cumulative Effects Management Framework (EV-CEMF) have been formed under joint management between the Ktunaxa Nation Council and the B.C. Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development (FLNRORD). A working group consisting of the Ktunaxa Nation Council, industry, community, organizations, and provincial government ministries has been formed to provide guidance and oversight for EV-CEMF activities. Valued component technical reports for Grizzly Bear, Riparian and westslope cutthroat trout (Davidson et al. 2018), bighorn sheep, and old and mature forest have been drafted, integrated into an overarching Cumulative Effects Assessment and Management Report (Elk Valley Cumulative Effects Management Framework Working Group 2018) and endorsed by the Working Group. These reports describe the historical, current, and future assessment of cumulative effects in the Elk Valley and provide management and mitigation recommendations. Next steps for the framework include the development of an Implementation Plan to identify priority actions and spatial locations to focus management and mitigation of cumulative effects in the valley which may include actions to address aquatic habitat connectivity issues (Ministry of Forests 2020). 2.1 Fisheries Fish species recorded in the upper Elk River watershed group (streams that drain into the Elk River) are detailed in Table 2.1 (MoE 2020a). Bull trout and westslope cutthrout trout are considered of special concern (blue-listed) provincially and westslope cutthrout trout (Pacific populations) are are listed under the Species at Risk Act by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada as a species of special concern (BC Species &amp; Ecosystem Explorer 2020b, 2020a; Schweigert et al. 2017). fiss_species_table &lt;- readr::read_csv(file = paste0(getwd(), &#39;/data/inputs_extracted/02_prep_report/fiss_species_table.csv&#39;)) # filter(`Species Code` != &#39;CT&#39;) %&gt;% fiss_species_table %&gt;% filter(`Upper Elk` != &#39;--&#39;) %&gt;% select(-`Upper Elk`, -Flathead) %&gt;% # rename(Elk = `Upper Elk`) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Fish species recorded in the study area (FISS 2020).&#39;) Table 2.1: Fish species recorded in the study area (FISS 2020).

All have habitat requirements during life history stages that include cold clean water and varied forms of cover (undercut banks, pool-riffle habitat and riparian vegetation). Stream-resident fish inhabitat headwater streams above barriers, complete their life cycle within a relatively small range and typically remain relatively small (i.e. &lt;200mm in length). Fluvial fish are migratory subpopulations that migrate between small spawning/rearing tributaries and larger adult rearing rivers. Lengths of fluvial fish generally reach more than 400mm. Finally, adfluvial subpopulations rear in lakes and migrate to spawning/rearing tributaries with lengths often exceeding 500mm (Schweigert et al. 2017). Spawning habitat for resident and fluvial subpopulations are documented as within the tailouts of deep pools at moderate to high-flow events within small, low-gradient streams with cold well-oxygenated water and clean unsilted gravels (Schmetterling 2001). Proximity to large woody debris, boulder or bedrock cover is important for spawning fish while residing in spawning tributaries as high mortality may result when suitable cover is lacking. The dominant substrate used for spawning is gravel (1.8 - 3.3cm diameter) with spawning occurring in late May and June towards the end of the spring freshet with rising water temperatures between 7-11\\(^\\circ\\)C. Nine of 11 westslope cutthrout trout radio-tagged in the Blackfoot River drainage, Montana by Schmetterling (2001) made movements to tributaries presumable for spawning. While in tributaries, fish movements to spawning sites averaged 12.5km where they stayed within an approximately 100m reach during the spawning period for between 15 and 63 days. Small perennial streams with a diversity of cover are important for juvenile rearing with young-of-year fish inhabiting low energy lateral habitats (i.e. shallow riffle or backwatered areas) with cover available. Larger juveniles move into pools with social dominance behaviors prevalent and based on fish size. Availability of pool habitat is important and limiting for parr which have large territories (Schweigert et al. 2017; Schmetterling 2001). The suitability of overwintering habitat is determined by groundwater influx and the absence of anchor ice with fluvial adults congregating in slow deep pools in the winter. Boulders and other large in-stream structures or off-channel habitat (beaver bonds and sloughs) provide cover for juveniles with adfluvial fish overwintering in lakes (Schweigert et al. 2017; Brown and Mackay 1995; Cope, Schwarz, and Prince 2017). In a swimming performance study conducted in an open-channel flume Blank et al. (2020) estimated the overall average swim speeds of westlope cutthrout trout (150mm - 290mm in length) at 0.84m/s with a maximum observed swim speed of 3.55m/s. The greatest threats to westslope cutthrout trout are hybridization with non-native rainbow trout and degradation of the environment due to forestry, hydroelectric development, mining, urbanization and agriculture (Schweigert et al. 2017). Lamson (2020) sampled over 2000 trout in the Upper Kootenay watershed from 2014 to 2019 with results of genotyping indicating consistently high levels of westslope cutthrout trout allele purity (i.e. very low levels of rainbow trout, yellowstone cutthrout trout or coastal cutthrout trout genetic introgression) throughout the Elk River watershed areas upstream of the Elko Dam. Boyer, Muhlfeld, and Allendorf (2008) sampled 31 sites in the upper Flathead River system within the United States (27 sites) and Canada (4 sites). Genetic introgression declined with latitude with no evidence of rainbow trout allelles within any westslope cutthrout trout sampled within the Canadian portion of the upper Flathead River. # load the csv built with R/02_prep_fig/analyze_fish_wct.R wct_elkr_grad &lt;- readr::read_csv(file = paste0(getwd(), &#39;/data/inputs_extracted/02_prep_report/wct_elkr_grad.csv&#39;)) Gradient of streams is an important determinant of habitat suitability for salmonids with lower gradient habitats often providing the most productive environments for both rearing and spawning while high gradient sections typically present upstream migration barriers and less available habitat. A summary of historic westslope cutthrout trout observations in the Elk River watershed group delineated by average gradient category of associated stream segments where they were captured is provided in Figure 2.5. Of 4003 observations, 93% were within stream segments with average gradients ranging from 0 - 8%. A total of 73% of historic observations were within stream segments with gradients between 0 - 3%, 12% were within stream segments with gradients ranging from 3 - 5% and 8% were within stream segments with gradients between 5 - 8% (MoE 2020a; Norris 2020). ##bar graph plot_wct_elkr_grad &lt;- wct_elkr_grad %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = Gradient, y = Percent)) + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;)+ theme_bw(base_size = 12)+ labs(x = &quot;Stream Gradient&quot;, y = &quot;WCT Occurrences (%)&quot;) + ggdark::dark_theme_bw() plot_wct_elkr_grad Figure 2.5: Summary of historic westslope cutthrout trout observations vs. stream gradient category. "],["methods.html", "3 Methods 3.1 Fish Sampling 3.2 Fish Habitat Assessment 3.3 Stream Discharge 3.4 Water Temperature", " 3 Methods 3.1 Fish Sampling Electrofishing was utilized for fish sampling according to stream inventory standards and procedures found in the Reconnaissance (1:20 000) Fish and Fish Habitat Inventory Manual (Resources Inventory Committee 2001). Individual captured fish were GPS’d, measured for fork length and released. A Fish Data Submission Spreadsheet Template - V 2.0, January 20, 2020 was populated for all sites and will be submitted to the provincial government under scientific fish collection permit CB22-755885. Habitat characteristics measured included water temperature, pH, conductivity, channel/wetted widths, pool depths, gradient, bankfull channel depth, stage, cover, large woody debris presence/abundance, channel bank characteristics, riparian vegetation type/structural stage, substrate and channel morphology. Downstream and upstream photographs were taken at each site and relevant features were recorded. Habitat data associated with electrofishing sites was collated on “Site Cards” with habitat characteristics recorded included channel widths, wetted widths, residual pool depths, gradients, bankfull depths, stage, temperature, conductivity, pH, cover by type, substrate and channel morphology (among others). Any potential obstacles to fish passage were inventoried with photos, physical descriptions and locations recorded on site cards. Surveyed routes were recorded with time-signatures on handheld GPS units. 3.2 Fish Habitat Assessment The Fish Habitat Assessment Procedures were developed by Johnston and Slaney (1996) to provide a standard framework for identifying needs and opportunities for fish habitat restoration. Field assessments in 2022 included Level 1 assessments - which are standardized protocols for characterizing average fish habitat conditions within stream reaches with the intent to identify scenarios that may limit fish production. Sample sites were divided into distinct geomorphic habitat units based on gradient, water flow characteristics, depth and size/position of the habitat unit relative to the main channel (habitat unit category). Habitat unit categories consisted of primary (occupy more than 50% of the wetted width of the main channel), secondary (side channels) and tertiary units (less than . These habitat units consisted of pools, glides, riffles and cascades which are described in more detail below: Pools - areas of slower, deeper water created by impoundment of water or scour (often associated with large woody debris) with a concave bottom profile and a water surface gradient near 0%. Minimum dimensions for the size of pools (miniumum area and associated minimum residual depth) are defined in Johnston and Slaney (1996) and based on the bankfull channel width of the stream. Glides were defined as areas of flat bottomed, fast-flowing and non-turbulent (laminar) flow. Riffles included areas of turbulent, fast flowing water usually consisting of shallow moderate-gradient areas with gravel or cobble bed material projecting above the water surface and obvious surface turbulence. Cascades included steeper, stepped “riffles” of bedrock or emergent substrates in channels with gradient greater than ~4%. The water surface is usually very turbulent and frothy and white in appearance. Sites were surveyed using a hip chain to track distance with the following attributes recorded for each habitat unit - gradient, mean water depth, mean wetted width, mean bankfull channel width, mean bankfull depth, pool characteristics (max depth, crest depth, residual depth), pool type (scour pool or impoundment), dominant/subdominant bed material type, large woody debris (total of all pieces &gt;10cm in diameter as well as total number of “functional” pieces broken out into multiple size categories), cover (% by type), disturbance indicators, riparian vegetation type, riparian structural stage, overstream canopy closure and spawning gravel amount/type. A clinometer was used to estimate gradient, channel measurements were taken using a tape measure and water depths measured using a measuring stick. Photographs were taken of representative habitats throughout the surveyed reaches. All field measurements were recorded on Level 1 Habitat Survey Data Form templates (Johnston and Slaney (1996)). GPS waypoints were collected at the beginning and end of all Primary habitat units to allow georeferenceing of field data. 3.3 Stream Discharge 3.4 Water Temperature "],["results.html", "4 Results 4.1 Weigert Creek - PSCIS crossing 197534 4.2 Brule Creek - PSCIS crossings 197533 and 197559", " 4 Results A map showing sample sites for fish sampling, fish habitat assessments and discharge in Weigert Creek and Brule Creek are summarized in Figure 4.1. knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/elk_fish_passage_2022.png&quot;) Figure 4.1: Map of Survey Sites # **Habitat Model Parameters** # * Spawning max gradient: 5.0%# # * Spawning discharge min (mean annual, m^3^/s): 0.05# # * Spawning discharge max (mean annual, m^3^/s): 76.00# # * Rearing max gradient: 7.0%# # * Rearing discharge min (mean annual, m^3^/s): 0.02# # * Rearing discharge max (mean annual, m^3^/s): 30.00 4.1 Weigert Creek - PSCIS crossing 197534 my_site &lt;- 197534 PSCIS crossing 197534 is located on Highway 43, approximately 23.5km north of the town of Sparwood approximately 1.3km upstream from the confluence with the Elk River.

The first site was located at the confluence to the Elk River where Weigert Creek redirects to the south. This section was surveyed for 520m. The stream was very fast flowing in sections. The average channel width was 4.38m, the average wetted width was 3.48m, and the average gradient was 3.1%. There were clumps of large woody debris that added complexity to stream habitat. Total cover was rated as moderate with cobbles dominating the in stream substrate. There were some sections that contained gravels suitable for westslope cutthroat and bull trout spawning. Habitat quality was rated as medium. The second site was located at the top of the first site, and was surveyed for 450m. Total cover was rated as moderate. The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels sub dominant. Hydrometric flow data was taken at the bottom of this site, approximately 550m downstream of crossing 197534. 4.1.4 Stream Characteristics Upstream The stream was surveyed at six different sites upstream of crossing 197534 (sites shown in Figure 4.1). Hydrometric flow data was taken at the ford (PSCIS crossing 197727). Total measured flow was 0.016m3/s. The bottom of the first site was located immediately upstream of crossing 197534 and was surveyed for 350m. The second site was in reach two and was surveyed for 300m to the ford. This section had a wide channel with fast flow. Many larger fish were caught (&gt;200mm). Some deep pools were present at the time of survey that are suitable for overwintering. The dominant in stream substrate was cobbles, followed by boulders. The third site was located upstream of the ford and was surveyed for 550m. Site four was also in reach two and was surveyed for 350m. This section had good flow with abundant boulders and large woody debris. There were some deep pools and abundant gravels suitable for spawning. The fifth site was in reach four and was surveyed for 330m. The stream was steep at some sections, with measured gradients up to 10.5%. The channel was wide with good flow. There were many deep pools suitable for rearing. Some gravels were present suitable for salmonid spawning. A couple of high cascades and large woody debris jams approximately 1m in height were seen that would be a barrier for the upstream migration of smaller fish. At site six in reach five, the stream was dry so the surveyors worked their way back to where the water began and surveyed 300m upstream. The stream channel was frequently confined and there was abundant cover. Overall, the habitat value upstream of crossing 197534 was medium to high for salmonid rearing and spawning. There were locations in each reach with patches of suitably sized gravels, deep pools, undercut banks, and stable debris; all of which are essential for the fish population. 4.1.5 Fish Sampling Electrofishing was conducted at eight sites with results summarised in Tables 4.4 - 4.7 and Figure 4.3.

Crossing 197533 is located on Busato Road 600m upstream from the confluece with the Elk River and crossing 197559 is located approximately 725m upstream from the confluence with the Elk River. Both crossings are the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure. Both crossings on Brule Creek as well as habiatt upstream and downstream was assessed in 2020 by (Irvine 2021). Two fords (PSCIS 197535 and 197536) were documented 700m and 2km upstream of crossing 197559 respectively. At the highway, Brule Creek is a 5th order stream with watershed characteristics detailed in Table 4.8. Brule Creek is known to contain westslope cutthrout trout, rainbow trout and bull trout downstream of the subject culverts and westslope cutthrout trout and rainbow trout above (MoE 2020b). On the south side of the upper watershed, at an elevation of 2000m, is the 5ha Josephine Lake (also known as Big Lake). The lake was stocked with westslope cutthrout trout from 1983 - 2000 (MoE 2020b; “Fish Inventories Data Queries” 2020). PSCIS stream crossings 197533 and 197559 were ranked as high priorities for follow up with new structures designs following habitat confirmations by Irvine (2021) due to the large size of the stream network upstream of the highway. Detailed reporting can be found here. In 2020, the channel was noted as dewatered immediately upstream of Highway 43 with intermittent pools only to a distance approximately 670 m upstream. fpr::fpr_table_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), footnote_text = &#39;Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the watershed area is above&#39;, scroll = F) Table 4.8: Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing 197559.

Habitat details are summarised in Table 4.11. The first site was located approximately 1km upstream from the culvert. This section was surveyed for 600m. The average channel width was 6.0m, the average wetted width was 3.5m, and the average gradient was 2.8%. The dominant streambed substrate was cobbles, with gravels sub-dominant. Total cover from overhanging vegetation and large woody debris was abundant. The habitat quality was rated as medium with moderate value for bull trout and westslope cutthrout trout and pockets of spawning gravels suitable for resident salmonids. The second site electrofished was located approximately 1km upstream of PSCIS crossing 197536. This section was surveyed for 310m to the location of a waterfall shown in Figure 4.15. This waterfall was approximately 7m in height, and blocks the upstream migration of all fish. This obstacle is listed in the BC Provincial Obstacles to Fish Passage catalogue (Ministry of Water, Land and Resource Stewardship 2023). At the time of survey, the average channel width was 7.5m, the average wetted width was 4.9m, and the average gradient was 2.1%. The dominant substrate was cobbles with boulders sub dominant. The habitat quality was considered moderate with abundant gravels suitable for resident and fluvial westslope cutthroat and bull trout spawning but few pools present that would be suitable for overwintering. tab_hab_summary %&gt;% filter(Site %like% my_site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of habitat details for electrofishing sites upstream of PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), scroll = F) Table 4.11: Summary of habitat details for electrofishing sites upstream of PSCIS crossing 197559.

Although habitat was suitable above Reach 2 and in fact had more complexity due to large woody debris abundance and percent composition of pools there were no fish captured in the areas samppled. this was a surprising result as the entire section of stream between where was sampled in Reach 3 and where fish were captured in Reach 2 was surveyed and although some drops were present no permanent barriers were present. 5.2 Brule Creek - PSCIS crossings 197533 and 197559 "],["references.html", "References", " References "],["session-info.html", "Session Info", " Session Info xfun::session_info() R version 4.2.2 (2022-10-31) Platform: aarch64-apple-darwin20 (64-bit) Running under: , RStudio 2022.12.0.353 Locale: en_US.UTF-8 / en_US.UTF-8 / en_US.UTF-8 / C / en_US.UTF-8 / en_US.UTF-8 Package version: AsioHeaders_1.22.1.2 askpass_1.1 assertthat_0.2.1 backports_1.4.1 base64enc_0.1-3 bcdata_0.4.0 BH_1.81.0.1 bibtex_0.5.1 bit_4.0.5 bit64_4.0.5 bitops_1.0-7 blob_1.2.3 bookdown_0.32 boot_1.3.28.1 broom_1.0.3 bslib_0.4.2 cachem_1.0.7 callr_3.7.3 cellranger_1.1.0 chk_0.8.1.9002 chron_2.3-59 citr_0.3.2 class_7.3-21 classInt_0.4-8 cli_3.6.0 clipr_0.8.0 codetools_0.2-19 colorspace_2.1-0 commonmark_1.8.1 compiler_4.2.2 conflicted_1.2.0 cpp11_0.4.3 crayon_1.5.2 crosstalk_1.2.0 crul_1.3 curl_5.0.0 data.table_1.14.8 datapasta_3.1.0 DBI_1.1.3 dbplyr_2.3.0 digest_0.6.31 doParallel_1.0.17 dplyr_1.1.0 dtplyr_1.3.0 e1071_1.7-13 elevatr_0.4.2 ellipsis_0.3.2 english_1.2-6 evaluate_0.20 exifr_0.3.2 fansi_1.0.4 farver_2.1.1 fasstr_0.5.0 fastmap_1.1.0 fishbc_0.2.1.9000 fitdistrplus_1.1.8 fontawesome_0.5.0 forcats_1.0.0 foreach_1.5.2 foreign_0.8-84 fpr_1.0.2.9000 fs_1.6.1 furrr_0.3.1 future_1.31.0 fwapgr_0.1.0.9013 gargle_1.3.0 generics_0.1.3 geojson_0.3.4 geojsonio_0.10.0 geojsonsf_2.0.3 geometries_0.2.1 ggdark_0.2.1 ggmap_3.0.1.900 ggplot2_3.4.1 globals_0.16.2 glue_1.6.2 googledrive_2.0.0 googlePolylines_0.8.2 googlesheets4_1.0.1 googleway_2.7.6 graphics_4.2.2 grDevices_4.2.2 grid_4.2.2 gridExtra_2.3 gtable_0.3.1 haven_2.5.1 highr_0.10 hms_1.1.2 htmltools_0.5.4 htmlwidgets_1.6.1 httpcode_0.3.0 httpuv_1.6.9 httr_1.4.5 ids_1.0.1 isoband_0.2.7 iterators_1.0.14 janitor_2.2.0 jpeg_0.1-10 jqr_1.2.3 jquerylib_0.1.4 jsonify_1.2.2 jsonlite_1.8.4 kableExtra_1.3.4 Kendall_2.2.1 KernSmooth_2.23-20 knitr_1.42 labeling_0.4.2 later_1.3.0 lattice_0.20-45 lazyeval_0.2.2 leafem_0.2.0 leaflet_2.1.1 leaflet.extras_1.0.0 leaflet.providers_1.9.0 lifecycle_1.0.3 listenv_0.9.0 lubridate_1.9.2 magick_2.7.3 magrittr_2.0.3 maptools_1.1-6 markdown_1.5 MASS_7.3.58.2 Matrix_1.5.3 memoise_2.0.1 methods_4.2.2 mgcv_1.8.41 mime_0.12 miniUI_0.1.1.1 modelr_0.1.10 munsell_0.5.0 nabor_0.5.0 nlme_3.1.162 openssl_2.0.5 openxlsx_4.2.5.2 pacman_0.5.1 pagedown_0.20.1 parallel_4.2.2 parallelly_1.34.0 pdftools_3.3.3 PearsonDS_1.2.3 pgfeatureserv_0.0.0.9003 pillar_1.8.1 pkgconfig_2.0.3 plogr_0.2.0 plyr_1.8.8 png_0.1-8 poisspatial_0.1.0.9000 poisutils_0.0.0.9010 prettyunits_1.1.1 processx_3.8.0 progress_1.2.2 progressr_0.13.0 promises_1.2.0.1 protolite_2.2.0 proxy_0.4-27 ps_1.7.2 purrr_1.0.1 qpdf_1.3.0 R6_2.5.1 ragg_1.2.5 rapidjsonr_1.2.0 rappdirs_0.3.3 raster_3.6-14 rayimage_0.9.1 rayshader_0.24.10 rbbt_0.0.0.9000 RColorBrewer_1.1.3 Rcpp_1.0.10 RcppArmadillo_0.12.0.1.0 RcppEigen_0.3.3.9.3 RcppRoll_0.3.0 readr_2.1.4 readwritesqlite_0.2.0 readxl_1.4.2 RefManageR_1.4.0 rematch_1.0.1 rematch2_2.1.2 remotes_2.4.2 reprex_2.0.2 rgdal_1.6-4 rgeos_0.6-1 rgl_1.0.1 RgoogleMaps_1.4.5.3 rlang_1.0.6 rmarkdown_2.20 RPostgres_1.4.5 RPostgreSQL_0.7-5 RSQLite_2.3.0 rstudioapi_0.14 rvest_1.0.3 s2_1.1.2 sass_0.4.5 scales_1.2.1 selectr_0.4.2 servr_0.25 sf_1.0-9 sfheaders_0.4.0 shiny_1.7.4 shinyjs_2.1.0 slippymath_0.3.1 snakecase_0.11.0 sourcetools_0.1.7.1 sp_1.6-0 splines_4.2.2 stats_4.2.2 stringi_1.7.12 stringr_1.5.0 survival_3.5.3 svglite_2.1.1 sys_3.4.1 systemfonts_1.0.4 terra_1.7-3 terrainmeshr_0.1.0 textshaping_0.3.6 tibble_3.1.8 tidyhydat_0.5.9 tidyr_1.3.0 tidyselect_1.2.0 tidyverse_2.0.0 timechange_0.2.0 tinytex_0.44 tools_4.2.2 triebeard_0.3.0 tzdb_0.3.0 units_0.8-1 urltools_1.7.3 utf8_1.2.3 utils_4.2.2 uuid_1.1.0 V8_4.2.2 vctrs_0.5.2 viridis_0.6.2 viridisLite_0.4.1 vroom_1.6.1 webshot_0.5.4 websocket_1.4.1 withr_2.5.0 wk_0.7.1 xfun_0.37 XML_3.99.0.13 xml2_1.3.3 xtable_1.8-4 yaml_2.3.7 yesno_0.1.2 zip_2.2.2 zyp_0.11 "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
