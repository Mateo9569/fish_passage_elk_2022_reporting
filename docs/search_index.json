"],["intro.html", "1 Introduction", " 1 Introduction Since 2020, the Canadian Wildlife Federation (CWF) has been working on a watershed connectivity remediation plan for the Elk River watershed that incorporates the provincial Strategic Approach protocol (Fish Passage Assessment, Habitat Confirmation, Design and Remediation), evolution of the bcfishpass analysis tools (Norris [2020] 2023) and local knowledge of the watershed to prioritize barriers and restore connectivity for westslope cutthroat trout and other species in a strategic manner. Nupqu Resource Limited Partnership (Nupqu) was retained by the CWF in the summer of 2022 to conduct fish habitat and fish sampling assessments at sites related to road-stream crossings within the Elk River watershed group as part of this connectivity restoration planning. Subject streams included Brule Creek, Weigert Creek and an unnamed tributary to Bighorn Creek. New Graph Environment Ltd. was sub-contracted by Nupqu to assist with project delivery. Assessments conducted in 2022 complement work completed in 2020 (72 fish passage assessments and 15 habitat confirmation assessments) and 2021 (92 fish passage assessments and 15 habitat confirmation assessments) which can be viewed interactively online at https://newgraphenvironment.github.io/fish_passage_elk_2020_reporting_cwf/ (Irvine 2021) and https://newgraphenvironment.github.io/fish_passage_elk_2021_reporting/ (Irvine 2022). The health and viability of freshwater fish populations can depend on access to tributary and off channel areas which provide refuge during high flows, opportunities for foraging, overwintering habitat, spawning habitat and summer rearing habitat (Bramblett et al. 2002; Swales and Levings 1989; Diebel et al. 2015). Culverts can present barriers to fish migration due to low water depth, increased water velocity, turbulence, a vertical drop at the culvert outlet and/or maintenance issues (Slaney, Zaldokas, and Watershed Restoration Program (B.C.) 1997; Cote et al. 2005). As the costs of works for remediation of fish passage issues through the replacement of road/stream crossings can be significant, acquisition of detailed habitat and fish sampling data can be helpful for understanding the value of associated habitats to target fish species, attempting to understand the extent of the issues potentially created by subject culverts as well as providing baseline data for assessing the benefits of remedial work post-fish passage remediation. "],["background.html", "2 Background 2.1 Fisheries", " 2 Background Study areas are tributary streams within the Elk River watershed group and eventually flow into the Elk River (Figure 2.1). The Elk River has a mean annual discharge of 26 m3/s at station 08NK016 near Sparwood and 47.3 m3/s at station 08NK016 near Fernie with flow patterns typical of high elevation watersheds on the west side of the Rocky Mountains which receive large amounts of precipitation as snow leading to peak levels of discharge during snowmelt, typically from May to July (Figures 2.2 - 2.4) (Environment and Canada 2020). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/Overview_ELKR.png&quot;) Figure 2.1: Overview map of Study Area knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08NK016.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/pixel.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08NK002.png&quot;) Figure 2.2: Hydrograph for Elk River near Sparwood (Station #08NK016) and near Fernie (Station #08NK002). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrology_stats_08NK016.png&quot;) Figure 2.3: Elk River Near Sparwood (Station #08NK016 - Lat 49.86562 Lon -114.86868).

Available daily discharge data from 1970 to 2020. 2.0.1 Ktunaxa Nation The project location is within the traditional territory of the Ktunaxa Nation (“Ktunaxa Nation” 2020) with Elk River components within an area known as Qukin ʔamakʔis, or Raven’s Land (Ministry of Forests 2020). When Europeans settled in the Kootenay Region around 200 hundred years ago, the Indian Reserves were created which lead to the seven Indian Bands: ʔakisq̓nuk- Columbia Lake Band (Windermere, BC); ʔaq̓am- St. Mary’s Band (Cranbrook, BC); ʔakink̓umǂasnuqǂiʔit- Tobacco Plains Band (Grasmere, BC); yaqan nuʔkiy- Lower Kootenay Band (Creston, BC); kyaknuqǂiʔit- Shuswap Band (Invermere, BC); ʔaq̓anqmi- Kootenai Tribe of Idaho (Bonners Ferry, Idaho); k̓upawi¢q̓nuk- Ksanka Band (Elmo, Montana) “Ktunaxa Nation” (2020) report the vision statement of the Ktunaxa as: “Kȼmak̓qa ksukⱡuⱡa·k kuk̓qani ȼ k̓itqakiⱡ haqa ksiʔⱡ ȼxa ʔa·kⱡukqaʔis ksukiⱡq̓ukaʔmi·k kiʔin Ktunaxa naʔs ʔamak̓ʔis.

Subsurface resource exploration and develpment is prohibited in the Flathead River watershed due to legislation enacted in 2011. At the time of reporting there were four active coal mines in the Elk River watershed (Fording River, Greenhills, Line Creek and Elkview), one closed mine (Coal Mountain) as well as multiple exploration projects and proposed new mines [@ministryofenergy2020EastKootenay]. First Nations, stakeholders, proponents and provincial and municipal governments have recognized that the region has been impacted by historic and current coal operations as well as other stresses such as forestry operations, wildfire, residential development, recreational activities and transportation. To assess the historic, current and potential future conditions of valued ecosystem components and to support resource management decisions within the region, the Provincial Cumulative Effects Framework and the Elk Valley Cumulative Effects Management Framework (EV-CEMF) have been formed under joint management between the Ktunaxa Nation Council and the B.C. Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development (FLNRORD). A working group consisting of the Ktunaxa Nation Council, industry, community, organizations, and provincial government ministries has been formed to provide guidance and oversight for EV-CEMF activities. Valued component technical reports for Grizzly Bear, Riparian and westslope cutthroat trout (Davidson et al. 2018), bighorn sheep, and old and mature forest have been drafted, integrated into an overarching Cumulative Effects Assessment and Management Report (Elk Valley Cumulative Effects Management Framework Working Group 2018) and endorsed by the Working Group. These reports describe the historical, current, and future assessment of cumulative effects in the Elk Valley and provide management and mitigation recommendations. Next steps for the framework include the development of an Implementation Plan to identify priority actions and spatial locations to focus management and mitigation of cumulative effects in the valley which may include actions to address aquatic habitat connectivity issues (Ministry of Forests 2020). 2.1 Fisheries Fish species recorded in the upper Elk River watershed group (streams that drain into the Elk River) are detailed in Table 2.1 (MoE 2020a). Bull trout and westslope cutthrout trout are considered of special concern (blue-listed) provincially and westslope cutthrout trout (Pacific populations) are are listed under the Species at Risk Act by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada as a species of special concern (BC Species &amp; Ecosystem Explorer 2020b, 2020a; Schweigert et al. 2017). fiss_species_table &lt;- readr::read_csv(file = paste0(getwd(), &#39;/data/inputs_extracted/02_prep_report/fiss_species_table.csv&#39;)) # filter(`Species Code` != &#39;CT&#39;) %&gt;% fiss_species_table %&gt;% filter(`Upper Elk` != &#39;--&#39;) %&gt;% select(-`Upper Elk`, -Flathead) %&gt;% # rename(Elk = `Upper Elk`) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Fish species recorded in the study area (FISS 2020).&#39;) Table 2.1: Fish species recorded in the study area (FISS 2020).

All have habitat requirements during life history stages that include cold clean water and varied forms of cover (undercut banks, pool-riffle habitat and riparian vegetation). Stream-resident fish inhabitat headwater streams above barriers, complete their life cycle within a relatively small range and typically remain relatively small (i.e. &lt;200mm in length). Fluvial fish are migratory subpopulations that migrate between small spawning/rearing tributaries and larger adult rearing rivers. Lengths of fluvial fish generally reach more than 400mm. Finally, adfluvial subpopulations rear in lakes and migrate to spawning/rearing tributaries with lengths often exceeding 500mm (Schweigert et al. 2017). Spawning habitat for resident and fluvial subpopulations are documented as within the tailouts of deep pools at moderate to high-flow events within small, low-gradient streams with cold well-oxygenated water and clean unsilted gravels (Schmetterling 2001). Proximity to large woody debris, boulder or bedrock cover is important for spawning fish while residing in spawning tributaries as high mortality may result when suitable cover is lacking. The dominant substrate used for spawning is gravel (1.8 - 3.3cm diameter) with spawning occurring in late May and June towards the end of the spring freshet with rising water temperatures between 7-11\\(^\\circ\\)C. Nine of 11 westslope cutthrout trout radio-tagged in the Blackfoot River drainage, Montana by Schmetterling (2001) made movements to tributaries presumable for spawning. While in tributaries, fish movements to spawning sites averaged 12.5km where they stayed within an approximately 100m reach during the spawning period for between 15 and 63 days. Small perennial streams with a diversity of cover are important for juvenile rearing with young-of-year fish inhabiting low energy lateral habitats (i.e. shallow riffle or backwatered areas) with cover available. Larger juveniles move into pools with social dominance behaviors prevalent and based on fish size. Availability of pool habitat is important and limiting for parr which have large territories (Schweigert et al. 2017; Schmetterling 2001). The suitability of overwintering habitat is determined by groundwater influx and the absence of anchor ice with fluvial adults congregating in slow deep pools in the winter. Boulders and other large in-stream structures or off-channel habitat (beaver bonds and sloughs) provide cover for juveniles with adfluvial fish overwintering in lakes (Schweigert et al. 2017; Brown and Mackay 1995; S. Cope, Schwarz, and Prince 2017). In a swimming performance study conducted in an open-channel flume Blank et al. (2020) estimated the overall average swim speeds of westlope cutthrout trout (150mm - 290mm in length) at 0.84m/s with a maximum observed swim speed of 3.55m/s. The greatest threats to westslope cutthrout trout are hybridization with non-native rainbow trout and degradation of the environment due to forestry, hydroelectric development, mining, urbanization and agriculture (Schweigert et al. 2017). Lamson (2020) sampled over 2000 trout in the Upper Kootenay watershed from 2014 to 2019 with results of genotyping indicating consistently high levels of westslope cutthrout trout allele purity (i.e. very low levels of rainbow trout, yellowstone cutthrout trout or coastal cutthrout trout genetic introgression) throughout the Elk River watershed areas upstream of the Elko Dam. Boyer, Muhlfeld, and Allendorf (2008) sampled 31 sites in the upper Flathead River system within the United States (27 sites) and Canada (4 sites). Genetic introgression declined with latitude with no evidence of rainbow trout allelles within any westslope cutthrout trout sampled within the Canadian portion of the upper Flathead River. # load the csv built with R/02_prep_fig/analyze_fish_wct.R wct_elkr_grad &lt;- readr::read_csv(file = paste0(getwd(), &#39;/data/inputs_extracted/02_prep_report/wct_elkr_grad.csv&#39;)) Gradient of streams is an important determinant of habitat suitability for salmonids with lower gradient habitats often providing the most productive environments for both rearing and spawning while high gradient sections typically present upstream migration barriers and less available habitat. A summary of historic westslope cutthrout trout observations in the Elk River watershed group delineated by average gradient category of associated stream segments where they were captured is provided in Figure 2.5. Of 4003 observations, 93% were within stream segments with average gradients ranging from 0 - 8%. A total of 73% of historic observations were within stream segments with gradients between 0 - 3%, 12% were within stream segments with gradients ranging from 3 - 5% and 8% were within stream segments with gradients between 5 - 8% (MoE 2020a; Norris 2020). ##bar graph plot_wct_elkr_grad &lt;- wct_elkr_grad %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = Gradient, y = Percent)) + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;)+ theme_bw(base_size = 12)+ labs(x = &quot;Stream Gradient&quot;, y = &quot;WCT Occurrences (%)&quot;) + ggdark::dark_theme_bw() plot_wct_elkr_grad Figure 2.5: Summary of historic westslope cutthrout trout observations vs. stream gradient category. "],["methods.html", "3 Methods 3.1 Fish Sampling 3.2 Fish Habitat Assessment", " 3 Methods 3.1 Fish Sampling Electrofishing was utilized for fish sampling according to stream inventory standards and procedures found in the Reconnaissance (1:20 000) Fish and Fish Habitat Inventory Manual (Resources Inventory Committee 2001). Individual captured fish were GPS’d, measured for fork length and released. A Fish Data Submission Spreadsheet Template - V 2.0, January 20, 2020 was populated for all sites and will be submitted to the provincial government under scientific fish collection permit CB22-755885. Habitat characteristics measured included water temperature, pH, conductivity, channel/wetted widths, pool depths, gradient, bankfull channel depth, stage, cover, large woody debris presence/abundance, channel bank characteristics, riparian vegetation type/structural stage, substrate and channel morphology. Downstream and upstream photographs were taken at each site and relevant features were recorded. Habitat data associated with electrofishing sites was collated on “Site Cards” with habitat characteristics recorded included channel widths, wetted widths, residual pool depths, gradients, bankfull depths, stage, temperature, conductivity, pH, cover by type, substrate and channel morphology (among others). Any potential obstacles to fish passage were inventoried with photos, physical descriptions and locations recorded on site cards. Surveyed routes were recorded with time-signatures on handheld GPS units. 3.2 Fish Habitat Assessment The Fish Habitat Assessment Procedures were developed by Johnston and Slaney (1996) to provide a standard framework for identifying needs and opportunities for fish habitat restoration. Field assessments in 2022 included Level 1 assessments - which are standardized protocols for characterizing average fish habitat conditions within stream reaches with the intent to identify scenarios that may limit fish production. Sample sites were divided into distinct geomorphic habitat units based on gradient, water flow characteristics, depth and size/position of the habitat unit relative to the main channel (habitat unit category). Habitat unit categories consisted of primary (occupy more than 50% of the wetted width of the main channel), secondary (side channels) and tertiary units (less than . These habitat units consisted of pools, glides, riffles and cascades which are described in more detail below: Pools - areas of slower, deeper water created by impoundment of water or scour (often associated with large woody debris) with a concave bottom profile and a water surface gradient near 0%. Minimum dimensions for the size of pools (miniumum area and associated minimum residual depth) are defined in Johnston and Slaney (1996) and based on the bankfull channel width of the stream. Glides were defined as areas of flat bottomed, fast-flowing and non-turbulent (laminar) flow. Riffles included areas of turbulent, fast flowing water usually consisting of shallow moderate-gradient areas with gravel or cobble bed material projecting above the water surface and obvious surface turbulence. Cascades included steeper, stepped “riffles” of bedrock or emergent substrates in channels with gradient greater than ~4%. The water surface is usually very turbulent and frothy and white in appearance. Sites were surveyed using a hip chain to track distance with the following attributes recorded for each habitat unit - gradient, mean water depth, mean wetted width, mean bankfull channel width, mean bankfull depth, pool characteristics (max depth, crest depth, residual depth), pool type (scour pool or impoundment), dominant/subdominant bed material type, large woody debris (total of all pieces &gt;10cm in diameter as well as total number of “functional” pieces broken out into multiple size categories), cover (% by type), disturbance indicators, riparian vegetation type, riparian structural stage, overstream canopy closure and spawning gravel amount/type. A clinometer was used to estimate gradient, channel measurements were taken using a tape measure and water depths measured using a measuring stick. Photographs were taken of representative habitats throughout the surveyed reaches. All field measurements were recorded on Level 1 Habitat Survey Data Form templates ((slaney_etal1997Fishhabitat?)). GPS waypoints were collected at the beginning and end of all Primary habitat units to allow georeferenceing of field data.

Develop strategies to explore cost and fisheries production benefits of stream crossing structure upgrades alongside alternative/additional restoration and enhancement investments such as land conservation/procurement/covenant, cattle exclusion, riparian restoration, habitat complexing, water conservation, commercial/recreational fishing management, water treatment and research. Look for opportunities to collaborate and leverage initiatives together for maximum likely restoration benefits. Refine barrier thresholds for road-stream crossing structures to explore metrics specific to life stage and life history types of species of interest. This will further focus efforts of potential remediation actions based on biological attributes (ex. timing of migration, size/direction of fish migrating, population dynamics, etc.) and could result in the consideration of interim “stop-gap” physical works to alter crossing characteristics that can address key connectivity issues yet be significantly less costly than structure replacements (ex. building up of downstream area with rock riffles to decrease the outlet drop size and/or increasing water depth within pipe with baffles and substrate additions). Model fish densities (fish/m2) vs. habitat/water quality characteristics (i.e. gradient, discharge, alkalinity, elevation, riparian health, distance from high order streams, etc.) using historically gathered electrofishing and remotely sensed geodata to inform crossing prioritization, future data acquisition needs and the monitoring of restoration actions. Continue to develop bcfishpass,bcfishobs, fwapg, bcdata, fpr and share data analysis and presentation tools that are open source, scaleable and facilitate continual improvement. Tools should continue to be flexible and well documented to allow the future incorporation of alternative fragmentation indicators, habitat gain/value metrics and watershed sensitivity indicators. Continue to collaborate with potential partners to build relationships, explore perspectives and develop “road maps” for aquatic restoration in different situations (MoT roads, rail lines, permit roads of different usages, FSRs, etc.) – documenting the people involved, discussions and processes that are undertaken, funding options, synergies, measures of success, etc. knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE) source(&#39;scripts/packages.R&#39;) source(&#39;scripts/tables.R&#39;) my_site &lt;- 197534 "],["weigert-creek---197534---appendix.html", "Weigert Creek - 197534 - Appendix Site Location Background Fish Sampling Results", " Weigert Creek - 197534 - Appendix Site Location PSCIS crossing 197534 is located on Highway 43, approximately 23.5km north of the town of Sparwood.

This crossing is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure. This stream was assessed in 2020 by (Irvine 2021). Two fords (PSCIS 197535 and 197536) were documented 700m and 2km upstream of crossing 197559 respectively. 5.1 Background At the highway, Brule Creek is a 5th order stream with watershed characteristics detailed in Table 5.6. Brule Creek is known to contain westslope cutthrout trout, rainbow trout and bull trout downstream of the subject culverts and westslope cutthrout trout and rainbow trout above (MoE 2020b). On the south side of the upper watershed, at an elevation of 2000m, is the 5ha Josephine Lake (also known as Big Lake). The lake was stocked with westslope cutthrout trout from 1983 - 2000 (MoE 2020b; “Fish Inventories Data Queries” 2020). PSCIS stream crossing 197559 was ranked as a high priority for follow up with new structure designs following habitat confirmations by Irvine (2021) due to the large size of the stream network upstream of the highway and because Brule Creek is a 5th order stream.

Stream Characteristics Upstream The stream was surveyed at two different sites upstream of crossing 197559. The first site was located approximately 1km from the culvert. This section was surveyed for 600m (Figure 5.2). The second site was located approximately 1km upstream of modelled crossing 197536. This section was surveyed for 310m to the location of a waterfall (Figure 5.5). This waterfall was approximately 5m in height, and blocks the upstream migration of all fish. This obstacle is listed in the Canadian Aquatic Barrier Database, as well as bcfishpass (Canadian Wildlife Federation 2023). Stream habitat quality is shown in Figures 5.3 - 5.4.
